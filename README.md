Pong-game
during this project we built a working pong game utilzing only javascript


the pong game consist of :
differnt modules where used and the import function was used to import the files to the main file,

we used a ES2015  syntax objects with constructors, properties, and methods.
there were esentially 6 modules which were used.


at the end of this project:
i felt more familiar using javascript classes, functions and methods.
the proyect brought to me another level of understanding to these concepts.
